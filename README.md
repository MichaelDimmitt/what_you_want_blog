# what_you_want_blog
hopefully this will be a good way for newcomers on github to become used to making pull requests that get merged. 

## Kind of like AskMeAnything on reddit. 
Ask me things and I will blog and give you the result. 

<b>to the person viewing this: </b>
<br>"modify the readme, 
<br>tell me what you would like me to blog and I will post a link to the resulting article that I write."


## some examples that currently exist.

### newcomer 

Michael, There are a few questions from a newcomer:
 - there is a legend in the world of newcomers that say if you want to become an IT you should go either to web dev or QA 
but in your article - https://michaeldimmitt.wordpress.com/2017/07/12/anyone-any-age-program-fluency/ =>
(I do not recommend for beginners)WebLanguages. 
- I think there is bearly highlighted information for newcomers in an appropriate way, all articles seem like copy/paste.
there are not paths or roadmaps for newcomers and what they going to deal with 
 
@Vladamir, I still need to write the Roadmap that you are talking about. that will be a seprate blog post. However take a look at this post which is still unfinished. 

Please read and tell me if this is good for beginners.
Please provide feedback on how it could be improved, thanks Michael Dimmitt.
