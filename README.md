# what_you_want_blog
hopefully this will be a good way for newcomers on github to become used to making pull requests that get merged. 

## Kind of like AskMeAnything on reddit. 
Ask me things and I will blog and give you the result. 

<b>to the person viewing this: </b>
<br>"modify the readme, 
<br>tell me what you would like me to blog and I will post a link to the resulting article that I write."


## some examples that currently exist.

### newcomer 

Michael, There are a few questions from a newcomer:
 - there is a legend in the world of newcomers that say if you want to become an IT you should go either to web dev or QA 
but in your article - https://michaeldimmitt.wordpress.com/2017/07/12/anyone-any-age-program-fluency/ =>
(I do not recommend for beginners)WebLanguages. 
- I think there is bearly highlighted information for newcomers in an appropriate way, all articles seem like copy/paste.
there are not paths or roadmaps for newcomers and what they going to deal with
